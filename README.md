## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science at Concordia University in Montreal. My experience in these fields is foundational, and I'm committed to expanding my knowledge and skills. I've completed several courses in Computer Science and Data Science and am working towards earning certificates in both Java and Python. I'm eager to gain practical experience through internships to apply my skills in real-world settings. With strong communication skills, I'm open to meeting new people, both within my field and beyond, to collaborate and learn from diverse perspectives.
